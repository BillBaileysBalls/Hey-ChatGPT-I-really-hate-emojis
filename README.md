# Hey-ChatGPT-I-really-hate-emojis
## 🚫 ChatGPT Emoji Remover

A self-contained HTML tool to remove those annoying emojis that ChatGPT keeps adding to everything.

## Why This Tool Exists

ChatGPT has started peppering its responses with unnecessary emojis, and frankly, everyone hates them. While OpenAI says there's nothing they can do until the next update, this tool provides an immediate solution for cleaning up ChatGPT output.

Whether you're copying code, documentation, or any text response from ChatGPT, this tool will strip out all the emoji clutter while preserving your formatting.

## What It Does

- **Removes emojis** from any text while preserving important whitespace
- **Preserves code formatting** - won't mess up your indentation or intentional spacing
- **Intelligent space cleanup** - prevents double spaces where emojis were removed
- **Selective removal** - choose which types of emojis to remove with granular control
- **Works offline** - completely self-contained, no internet required

## Key Features

### Smart Whitespace Handling
This tool is specifically designed for code and formatted text. It intelligently handles spacing:

- `### 🔒 How it works` → `### How it works` (removes double space)
- `function✨() {` → `function() {` (preserves code structure)
- `if    (condition)` → `if    (condition)` (keeps intentional spacing)

### Selective Emoji Removal
Choose exactly which emoji categories to remove:
- 😀 Emoticons
- 🌟 Misc Symbols
